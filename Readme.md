# Delayed Admin

A tool for administrators to (temporarily) drop admin privileges - to use tools like [Parental Controls](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18571), [Self Control](http://selfcontrolapp.com), [etc.](https://github.com/miheerdew/delayed-admin/wiki/Tools), on themselves!

Currently, it's tested on MacOS, but should work on Unix like systems. The aim is to create a tool like [abmindicate](http://www.pluckeye.net/abmindicate.html) for MacOS/Unix.

Feel free to open a pull request if you have any suggestions/feedback.

## Warning
**This project is still a prototype. Only follow these instructions if you know what you are doing. There might be a possibility of locking yourself out of admin privilages. To prevent this, make another administrator account.**

## How does it work?

### First an analogy
Say you have a box containing an endless supply of candies, and that lately you have been eating lot more candy than you should be. After all, whenever you have an impulse to eat candy, it is so easy to just open the box and grab one. It's so hard to fight the craving!

 Now, imagine instead that the box had a mechanism to ensures that it only opens 20 min after you tell it to. Then it would be so much easier to resist the temptation of eating the candy (becuse even though the craving is there, there is nothing you can do about it, at least until the next 20 min).

This is the principle Delayed Admin is based upon. It gives you a delayed access to admin privilieges (the candy-box).

### The technical bit

On installation, a new group called `delayed-admin` is created with an entry in the sudoers file allowing anyone in the `delayed-admin` group to run the script `/usr/local/bin/delayed` as root. The `delayed` script simply sleeps for some amount of time (as specified in `/etc/delayed-admin.conf`) and then runs the command specified in the argument as root.


## Why would anyone use this?

 Self-control. Suppose I want to enforce a no-screen time (to sleep early), or restrict visits to certain addictive websites on my Laptop. Sure, I can write a script that will log me out at a certain times and use url-blacklists to prevent access to those websites, but being an administrator for my Laptop, I can also disable those scripts and blacklists anytime.

This is where delayed admin helps. I only retain a delayed adminstrator access, so that I can still have adminstrator access, but canâ€™t use it at my whims (since one needs to wait for some time between wanting the access and getting it) and actions are more deliberate. In this example I would use delayed-admin to setup those scripts/blacklists but it will deter me from instantly disabling them.

## Installation and setup

### MacOS

```
#Install delayed-admin
sudo ./setup.sh install

#Add the current user to the delayed-admin group
sudo dseditgroup -o edit -a "$USER" -t user delayed-admin

#Remove the current user from the admin group
sudo dseditgroup -o edit -d "$USER" -t user admin
```

### Linux

```
#Install delayed-admin
sudo ./setup.sh install

#Add the current user to the delayed-admin group
usermod -a -G delayed-admin "$USER"

#Remove the current user from the sudo group
sudo gpasswd -d "$USER" sudo
```

## Uninstall
Before you uninstall, first ensure that you have root access. Then run:

```
sudo ./setup.sh uninstall
```

## Usage

If you followed the instruction in [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup), now your account must belong to the `delayed-admin` group, but not to the `admin` (or `sudo`) group. Hence you can't directly run `sudo` on any command, but you can run `sudo delayed`:

```
sudo delayed whoami
# Outputs "root" after 30 sec.

sudo delayed
# Get a root shell after 30 sec.
```

The delay can be changed by changing the number of seconds in `/etc/delayed-admin.conf`. After you are comfortable, it is recommended to change it to 1200 (i.e. 20 min).
